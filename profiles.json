Some say if you listen very closely at night, you can hear the angelic voice of Ardian sing the national anthem every night before he goes to sleep.  When it comes to hobbies, Ardian has three: Busch Light, The Second Amendment, and Chevrolet trucks. 'Murica."

If you are out eating burgers with A.J. make sure you watch your food as burgers have been known to disappear. He suspects that he may have been the Hamburglar in a previous life and his friends agree. He has some sticky fingers when it comes to burgers."
